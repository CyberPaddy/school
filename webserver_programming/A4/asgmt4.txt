Program a simple "one-handed robber" robber.php, where each new page load displays three optional (preferably equal in width) jpg images side by side. Images can be copied to the desired directory (at least 3pcs). It is advisable to start solving the problem by making the program print 3 random numbers. Use PHP's rand () function: <URL: www.php.net/rand/>

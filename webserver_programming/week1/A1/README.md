### Assignment 1

Write a separate form and a separate PHP program that asks the user to share their weight e.g.

What is your weight in kilograms: 78
My weight is 73kg. You seem to have weight problems.

So the user only inputs their weight as an integer, the weight of the PHP program is always 5kg smaller.
There is no need to check the input data.
Use the POST request method in the form.
